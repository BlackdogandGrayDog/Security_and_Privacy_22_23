# AI Privacy Defense Project: Healthcare Diagnosis System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an AI Privacy Defense project in the context of a comprehensive medical diagnosis system. The project focuses on addressing potential security and privacy risks while providing a centralized platform for data storage, management, and analysis in the healthcare industry.

## Introduction

The healthcare industry has been revolutionized by sophisticated medical diagnosis systems that integrate Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices or medical imaging equipment and data processing algorithms to facilitate the early detection and prevention of life-threatening diseases. Our study presents a comprehensive medical diagnosis system that provides a central platform for data storage, management, and analysis. This system aims to improve patient care and enable healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.

## Contents

This repository is organized into three primary folders:

1. **Server**: This folder contains the system built on the cloud server, which includes defense mechanisms such as encryption of authentication packets, a recovery system, and a suspend mechanism. These measures help protect the system against unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential attacks.

2. **Local_Host**: This folder houses the system built on a virtual machine for testing various types of attacks and their corresponding defense mechanisms. The Local_Host environment enables testing and evaluation of the implemented security measures before deploying them to the cloud server.

3. **Encrypted_Model**: This folder contains defense mechanisms specifically designed to protect machine learning models against tampering and stealing attacks. These mechanisms include Model AES encryption, Secure multi-party computation, Homomorphic encryption, and Noise obfuscation.

## Usage

To use the AI Privacy Defense project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or cloud server.
2. Navigate to the desired folder (Server, Local_Host, or Encrypted_Model) based on your requirements.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each folder's README file to set up and configure the system.

Please note that the Local_Host environment is designed for testing purposes only and should not be used for production deployments.
